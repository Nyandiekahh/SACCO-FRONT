## Overview

Welcome to the most comprehensive SACCO (Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization) management system that'll make your grandmother's chama look like it's from the future! üöÄ

This React-based frontend application provides a complete digital transformation solution for SACCOs, chamas, investment clubs, and any group of people who've ever tried to track money using WhatsApp messages and Excel sheets that look like they were designed by a caffeinated accountant at 3 AM.

## Key Features

### üéØ For Everyone
- **Multi-role Support**: Admin and Member dashboards (because not everyone can be the village accountant)
- **Real-time Financial Tracking**: No more "nilikuwa nimeweka pesa wapi?" moments
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Works on your Nokia 3310... just kidding, but it works great on mobile!
- **Document Management**: Upload and verify KYC documents (goodbye, photocopying queues!)

### üí≥ Payment Integration
- **Paybill Integration**: Full DARAJA API integration for established SACCOs with paybills
- **Manual Entry**: Perfect for startups and small chamas who are still figuring out technology
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: M-Pesa, bank transfers, cash (yes, we still accept those crumpled notes)

### üìä Financial Management
- **Contribution Tracking**: Monthly contributions and share capital management
- **Loan Management**: From application to repayment (with gentle reminders for defaulters)
- **Guarantor System**: Because trust is good, but guarantors are better
- **Financial Reports**: Charts that actually make sense (unlike your uncle's investment advice)
